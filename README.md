# argocd-applicationset

## TODO

1. Is deploying `kustomization` and `helm` together possible?
1. Test that `argo-rollouts` works with an `applicationset`
1. Identify how to pass annotations to an `application` managed by the `applicationset`
1. Simulate what the behavior is when switching the branch (say when wanting to upgrade).
